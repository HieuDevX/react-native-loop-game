## Requirements to run locally

> Just in case if you ran into errors make sure you're using correct react-native & nodejs version.

- Run `npm run setup` to install required global npm packages with correct versions

## Getting started with code

> Please note that this project's code is not meant for beginners! If you're just getting started with flutter I recommend you to explore some ToDo and basic setState apps and get yourself familiar with react eco-system becuase in this project intermediate and advance implementations are use which will confuse you and won't help much in terms of learning.

- `init.js` initialize default settings like styles, theme & API.
